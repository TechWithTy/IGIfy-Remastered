# IGIfy Remastered

With IGIfy Remastered, you can effortlessly attempt to increase your followers by following and unfollowing accounts to encourage follow-backs. **It works seamlessly for both private and public accounts**. Gains depend on user behavior and Instagram's algorithm‚Äîresults vary. Initial uses may yield 0-50 followers, with subsequent uses adding 0-30. To maintain account safety, use the script every 2-3 days and enable niche targeting for better results. The script provides info on actions taken and detected gains.

## Installation üì•

- **Make sure you're logged in to your Instagram account from Firefox before executing IGFI.**

### Linux üêß

```bash
sudo su
git clone https://github.com/TechWithTy/IGIfy-Remastered
cd IGIfy-Remastered
sudo pip install -r ./files/requirements.txt
python3 ./cookies.py # generates a session file (not cookies.sqlite)
python3 ./igfi.py -u <username> -p <password> --session <path_to_session_file>
```

### Windows ü™ü

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechWithTy/IGIfy-Remastered
cd IGIfy-Remastered
pip install -r ./files/requirements.txt
python cookies.py  # generates a session file (not cookies.sqlite)
python igfi.py -u <username> -p <password> --session <path_to_session_file>
```

### MacOS üçé

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechWithTy/IGIfy-Remastered
cd IGIfy-Remastered
python -m pip install -r ./files/requirements.txt
python3 ./cookies.py # generates a session file (not cookies.sqlite)
python3 ./igfi.py -u <username> -p <password> --session <path_to_session_file>
```

### Docker üêã

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechWithTy/IGIfy-Remastered
cd IGIfy-Remastered
python3 ./cookies.py # this command will generate the value for the <path_to_session_file>
docker build -t igfi .
docker run -e DOCKER_CONTAINER=true -e USERNAME=<username> -e PASSWORD=<password> -e SESSION=<path_to_session_file> -p 4000:4000 -it igfi
```

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Dependency Conflicts

If you encounter dependency conflicts when installing requirements, it's likely because you have other Python packages installed that require different versions of the same dependencies (e.g., pydantic, rich).

**Solutions:**

1. **Use the provided setup scripts** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # For Linux/Mac
   bash setup.sh

   # For Windows
   setup.bat
   ```

2. **Manual virtual environment setup**:
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # On Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r files/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update pip**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

### Common Issues

- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Make sure you're in the virtual environment or have installed all requirements
- **Version conflicts**: Always use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects
- **Instagram login errors**: Run `python cookies.py` first to generate session data

### Windows ü™ü

```bash
git clone https://github.com/new92/IGFI
cd IGFI
python -m venv igfi
.\igfi\scripts\activate
pip install -r ./files/requirements.txt
python cookies.py  # generates a session file (not cookies.sqlite)
python igfi.py -u <username> -p <password> --session <path_to_session_file>
```

### Linux üêß / MacOS üçé

```bash
git clone https://github.com/new92/IGFI
cd IGFI
python -m venv igfi
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./files/requirements.txt
python3 ./cookies.py # generates a session file (not cookies.sqlite)
python3 ./igfi.py -u <username> -p <password> --session <path_to_session_file>

## Usage üìö

- Full usage guide with examples, batching, follow-only, cleanup, and hashtag targeting is in `USAGE.md`.

### Important: Passing --session on Windows

- Keep the entire command on one line and quote the path.
- `--session` must point to the session file created by `cookies.py` (or an instagrapi settings JSON) ‚Äî not to `cookies.sqlite`.

Examples:

- CMD:
  - `python igfi.py -u "<username_or_email>" -p "<password>" --session "C:\\Users\\<you>\\Documents\\Github\\IGFI\\ig_session.json"`
- PowerShell:
  - `python .\igfi.py -u '<username_or_email>' -p '<password>' --session 'C:\\Users\\<you>\\Documents\\Github\\IGFI\\ig_session.json'`
- Git Bash:
  - `python igfi.py -u "<username_or_email>" -p "<password>" --session "/c/Users/<you>/Documents/Github/IGFI/ig_session.json"`
```

##### Virtual environment deactivation üì≠

### Question 3

### Question 4

- Can my account get blocked by using this script ?

Answer ‚û°Ô∏è Only if you're using a very old version of Instagram. But the script has been tested in several accounts and none of them got blocked.
